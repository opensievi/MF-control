# MF-control

Project to modernize old tractor electrical system. Schematics will be
added later on, at this point project only holds starting structure
for user interface.

The tractor in question for the project is MF365 from 1989. However the 
basic controls should work more or less without modifications on pretty
much every vehicle.

## What to control

Incomprehensible list:
 - Main power (toggle-relay circuit with auto-off)
 - Lights (some of them)
 - Heater fan
 - Heater valve
 - Starter

## What to measure

Incomprehensible list:
 - Temperature outside/inside
 - Motor temperature(s)
 - Engine RPM
 - Speed (km/h)
 - Power drive RPM


## Project management

TODO etc at github, futher on we'll add quite a few pieces to the
software and electronics. 

## Folder structure

WiringDiagrams/ - Location for wiring diagrams (images etc)
MFC/ - Arduino-based program(s) to actually run the electronics
